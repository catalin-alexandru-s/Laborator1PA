--For the compulsory exercise--

Firstly I had to show the "Hello World!" text after that I had to define an array of strings that contains programming languages.
I generated a random number using the Math.random() function and I had to do some calculations such as adding and multiplying, for which I created two functions for the operations.
Then, I had to break the number generated into digits to make the sum between them, with the sumaCif function, because the compiler generates such a big number, the sum of the digits will be formed in a 
two-digit number and we don't want that, so I had to create another function(sumaFin) which checks if the number is bigger than 10 meaning that, if it is formed by a two-digit number
it will continue to break it, until we are left with a one-digit number.
For the conversion of the binary number and hexadecimal I used two functions for converting them in a decimal number.
Finally I had to display on the screen "Willy-nilly, this semester I will learn " + languages[result] where the result is a number from the calculations and breaking it into  digits, which will be 9 meaning that the result will be equal to 'Java'.
